### In this project:

- Add your day to day expenses;
- Keep track of your expenses;
- Organize your life,  :-P
- All this with fully mobile responsive experience!:-)

This project was proposed by Jorge Sant Ana, in [THIS](https://www.udemy.com/web-completo/) course and It was heavily modified by me, like all of the start layout and some javascript things.
